# Programming-for-Data-Analysis-Project

This project was completed by - Keith Ryan (G00387816@gmit.ie)

## Overview of the Dataset
The idea of this project was to generate data for 500 people defining their Gender, Age, Height, BMI Category, Weight.

## Running the Notebook
The cells throughout this notebook go from beginning to end linearly, most of the work was done in figuring out appropriate ways to generate the data so the bulk of content can be found in markdown cells, with relatively few lines of actual python code needed to generate the data.
