    "An example to illustrate this (as provided by the lecturer), is to consider students enrolled in a module, based on this example it seems sensible to consider each student has a grade at the end of a module and as we know from the common misconception that lecturers grade to a bell curve, is in fact due to the how phenomenon such as this tends to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "Following on from this we can assert that there are other factors that will help to determine their grade, such as their level of education going into this module (it stands to reason that someone with a PhD will in general outperform someone who has a bachelors degree), the amount of hours a student studies is also probably effecting their grade as is perhaps whether the student is full time or part time.  \n",
